## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo is to create a low code platform for Airflow development. It should be able to drag and drop to create airflow tasks. All required parameters should be as input dropdown or selection as node. This repo will mainly use reactflow library for development.

Currently we development airflow job by writting python script.
